# Holys-Overlay-V2
LUA script for stand

Find the default info overlay of stand too ugly or harder to read?
Lets fix that by drawing one with LUA.

Enables an info overlay displaying the following:
- Session Type
- Host
- Script Host
- Players
- Modders
- Friends
- Strangers
- Current Time (IRL)
- FPS
- Ped Pool
- Vehicle Pool
- Objes Pool
- Pickup Pool

Old version used a lib that now doesnt work anymore as i intended so now using another way to achieve this. Removed player window due it not being used. DM me on discord with any questions.
