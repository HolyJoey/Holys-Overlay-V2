# Holys-Overlay-V2
LUA script for stand

Find the default info overlay of stand look bad? Are you just too fucking blind to read that plain text?
Lets fix that by drawing one with LUA.

Enables an info overlay displaying the following: 
- Session Type
- Host
- Script Host
- Players
- Modders
- Friends
- Strangers
- Current Time (IRL)
- FPS
- Ped Pool
- Vehicle Pool
- Objes Pool
- Pickup Pool

Old version used a lib that now doesnt work anymore exactly as i intended so now using another way to achieve this. Looks a bit different now so use the one you like most. Removed player window due it not being used.
